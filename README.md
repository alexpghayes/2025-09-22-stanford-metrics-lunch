# Understanding linear regression for social networks

Understanding social influence is a fundamental task in our increasingly connected society. One canonical tool for estimating social influences is the linear-in-means model, a form of linear regression for social networks that sees extensive use in the social sciences. Despite initial concerns about identifiability in these models, standard wisdom now suggests that linear-in-means models are a reliable tool for estimating peer effects. Contrary to this belief, we show that even when peer effects are identified in the linear-in-means model, they may be impossible to estimate. This surprising result arises from a subtle asymptotic collinearity issue, and suggests that estimates from the linear-in-means model may be less reliable than previously believed. We also show that asymptotic collinearity can be avoided in latent space models, and discuss avenues for future progress.
