In this paper, we review the literature studying econometric methods for the analysis of linear models of social effects, a class that includes the `linear-in-means' local average model, the local aggregate model, and models where network statistics affect outcomes. We provide an overview of the underlying theoretical models, before discussing conditions for identification using observational and experimental/quasi-experimental data.},

  abstract = {Consider data consisting of pairwise measurements, such as presence or absence of links between pairs of objects. These data arise, for instance, in the analysis of protein interactions and gene regulatory networks, collections of author-recipient email, and social networks. Analyzing pairwise measurements with probabilistic models requires special assumptions, since the usual independence or exchangeability assumptions no longer hold. Here we introduce a class of variance allocation models for pairwise measurements: mixed membership stochastic blockmodels. These models combine global parameters that instantiate dense patches of connectivity (blockmodel) with local parameters that instantiate node-specific variability in the connections (mixed membership). We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference. We demonstrate the advantages of mixed membership stochastic blockmodels with applications to social networks and protein interaction networks.},

  abstract = {Individual outcomes are highly correlated with group average outcomes, a fact often interpreted as a causal peer effect. Without covariates, however, outcome-on-outcome peer effects are vacuous, either unity or, if the average is defined as a leave-out mean, determined by a generic intraclass correlation coefficient. When pre-determined peer characteristics are introduced as covariates in a model linking individual outcomes with group averages, the question of whether peer effects or social spillovers exist is econometrically identical to that of whether a 2SLS estimator using group dummies to instrument individual characteristics differs from OLS estimates of the effect of these characteristics. The interpretation of results from models that rely solely on chance variation in peer groups is therefore complicated by bias from weak instruments. With systematic variation in group composition, the weak IV issue falls away, but the resulting 2SLS estimates can be expected to exceed the corresponding OLS estimates as a result of measurement error and for other reasons unrelated to social effects. Research designs that manipulate peer characteristics in a manner unrelated to individual characteristics provide the most compelling evidence on the nature of social spillovers. As an empirical matter, designs of this sort have mostly uncovered little in the way of socially significant causal effects.},

The class includes null hypotheses that limit the effect of one unit's treatment status on another according to the distance between units, for example, the hypothesis might specify that the treatment status of immediate neighbors has no effect, or that units more than two edges away have no effect. We also consider hypotheses concerning the validity of sparsification of a network (e.g., based on the strength of ties) and hypotheses restricting heterogeneity in peer effects (so that, e.g., only the number or fraction treated among neighboring units matters). Our general approach is to define an artificial experiment, such that the null hypothesis that was not sharp for the original experiment is sharp for the artificial experiment, and such that the randomization analysis for the artificial experiment is validated by the design of the original experiment.},

Current approaches to deal with interference, in theory and in practice, often make restrictive assumptions on its structure---for instance, assuming that interference is local---even when using otherwise nonparametric inference strategies. This reliance on explicit restrictions on the interference mechanism suggests a shared intuition that inference is impossible without any assumptions on the interference structure. In this paper, we begin by formalizing this intuition in the context of a classical nonparametric approach to inference, referred to as design-based inference of causal effects.

This lack of concentration in large samples is often observed empirically, in randomized experiments in which interference of some form is expected to be present. This result has direct consequences for the design and analysis of large experiments---for instance, in online social platforms---where the belief is that large sample sizes automatically guarantee small variance.

Particular emphasis is placed upon practical applications of the models in plant ecology when the variates are binary or Gaussian. Some aspects of infinite lattice Gaussian processes are discussed. Methods of statistical analysis for lattice schemes are proposed, including a very flexible coding technique. The methods are illustrated by two numerical examples. It is maintained throughout that the conditional probability approach to the specification and analysis of spatial interaction is more attractive than the alternative joint probability approach.},

This is also the case for the forecasts collected in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/). Forecast evaluation metrics like the logarithmic score, which has been applied in several infectious disease forecasting challenges, are then not available as they require full predictive distributions. This article provides an overview of how established methods for the evaluation of quantile and interval forecasts can be applied to epidemic forecasts in this format. Specifically, we discuss the computation and interpretation of the weighted interval score, which is a proper score that approximates the continuous ranked probability score. It can be interpreted as a generalization of the absolute error to probabilistic forecasts and allows for a decomposition into a measure of sharpness and penalties for over- and underprediction.},

We consider an extended version of the linear-in-means model where interactions are structured through a social network. We assume that correlated unobservables are either absent, or treated as network fixed effects. We provide easy-to-check necessary and sufficient conditions for identification. We show that endogenous and exogenous effects are generally identified under network interaction, although identification may fail for some particular structures. We use data from the Add Health survey to provide an empirical application of our results on the consumption of recreational services (e.g., participation in artistic, sports and social activities) by secondary school students. Monte Carlo simulations calibrated on this application provide an analysis of the effects of some crucial characteristics of a network (i.e., density, intransitivity) on the estimates of peer effects. Our approach generalizes a number of previous results due to Manski [Manski, C., 1993. Identification of endogenous social effects: The reflection problem.

  abstract = {We survey the recent, fast-growing literature on peer effects in networks. An important recurring theme is that the causal identification of peer effects depends on the structure of the network itself. In the absence of correlated effects, the reflection problem is generally solved by network interactions even in nonlinear, heterogeneous models. By contrast, microfoundations are generally not identified. We discuss and assess the various approaches developed by economists to account for correlated effects and network endogeneity in particular. We classify these approaches in four broad categories: random peers, random shocks, structural endogeneity, and panel data. We review an emerging literature relaxing the assumption that the network is perfectly known. Throughout, we provide a critical reading of the existing literature and identify important gaps and directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) interventions among people who use drugs (PWUD) often have spillover, also known as interference or dissemination, which occurs when one participant's exposure affects another participant's outcome. PWUD are often members of networks defined by social, sexual, and drug-use partnerships and their receipt of interventions can affect other members in their network. For example, HIV interventions with possible spillover include educational training about HIV risk reduction, pre-exposure prophylaxis, or treatment as prevention. In turn, intervention effects frequently depend on the network structure, and intervention coverage levels and spillover can occur even if not measured in a study, possibly resulting in an underestimation of intervention effects. Recent methodological approaches were developed to assess spillover in the context of network-based studies. This tutorial provides an overview of different study designs for network-based studies and related methodological approaches for assessing spillover in each design. We also provide an overview of other important methodological issues in network studies, including causal influence in networks and missing data. Finally, we highlight applications of different designs and methods from studies of PWUD and conclude with an illustrative example from the Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) in Athens, Greece.},

Except for certain network structures, causal inference on the network in the presence of interference is difficult due to the entanglement between the treatment assignments and the interference levels. In this article, we conduct causal inference under interference on an observed, sparse but connected network, and we propose a novel design of experiments based on an independent set. Compared to conventional designs, the independent-set design focuses on an independent subset of data and controls their interference exposures through the assignments to the rest (auxiliary set). We provide a lower bound on the size of the independent set from a greedy algorithm , and justify the theoretical performance of estimators under the proposed design. Our approach is capable of estimating both spillover effects and treatment effects. We justify its superiority over conventional methods and illustrate the empirical performance through simulations.},

This paper proposes a community network vector autoregressive (CNAR) model, which utilizes the network structure to characterize the dependence and intra-community homogeneity of the high-dimensional time series. The CNAR model greatly increases the flexibility and generality of the network vector autoregressive (NAR) model proposed by Zhu et al. (2017) by allowing heterogeneous network effects across different network communities. In addition, the non-community-related latent factors are included to account for unknown cross-sectional dependence. The number of network communities can diverge as the network expands, which leads to estimating a diverging number of model parameters. We obtain a set of stationary conditions and develop an efficient two-step weighted least-squares estimator. The consistency and asymptotic normality properties of the estimators are established. Theoretical results show that the two-step estimator can further improve the efficiency of one-step estimator when the error admits a factor structure. The advantages of the CNAR model are illustrated on a variety of synthetic and real datasets.},

  abstract = {A/B tests on modern platforms, including social networks and two-sided marketplaces, often encounter challenges due to network interference. Recent research in causal inference under network interference has explored various experimental designs and estimation techniques to address this issue. However, existing methods, which typically rely on single experiments, often reach a performance bottleneck and face limitations in handling diverse interference structures. In contrast, we propose leveraging multiple experiments to overcome these limitations. In industry, the use of sequential experiments, often known as the ramp-up process, where traffic to the treatment gradually increases, is common due to operational needs like risk management and cost control. Our approach shifts the focus from operational aspects to the statistical advantages of merging data from multiple experiments. By combining data from sequentially conducted experiments, we aim to estimate the global average treatment effect (GATE) more effectively. In this paper, we begin by analyzing the bias and variance of the linear regression estimator for GATE under general linear network interference. We demonstrate that bias plays a dominant role in the bias-variance tradeoff and highlight the intrinsic bias reduction achieved by merging data from experiments with strictly different treatment proportions. Herein the improvement introduced by merging two steps of experimental data is essential. In addition, we show that merging more steps of experimental data is unnecessary under general linear interference, while it can become beneficial when nonlinear interference occurs. We also provide an intuitive and informative explanation for this significant bias reduction, as well as the synergetic effect between our merging methodology and cluster-level randomization. Furthermore, we look into a more advanced estimator based on graph neural networks (GNN). Through extensive simulation studies1, including novel and challenging scenarios such as square root interference, multihop interference, and dynamic graph structures, we show that the regression-based estimator benefits remarkably from training on merged experiment data, achieving outstanding statistical performance. Additionally, we also verify that most of our theoretical results and insights derived from linear regression can also be generalized to the GNN-based estimators.},

This paper proposes regression adjustment estimators for removing bias due to interference in Bernoulli randomized experiments. We use a fitted model to predict the counterfactual outcomes of global control and global treatment. Our work differs from standard regression adjustments in that the adjustment variables are constructed from functions of the treatment assignment vector, and that we allow the researcher to use a collection of any functions correlated with the response, turning the problem of detecting interference into a feature engineering problem. We characterize the distribution of the proposed estimator in a linear model setting and connect the results to the standard theory of regression adjustments under SUTVA. We then propose an estimator that allows for flexible machine learning estimators to be used for fitting a nonlinear interference functional form. We propose conducting statistical inference via bootstrap and resampling methods, which allow us to sidestep the complicated dependences implied by interference and instead rely on empirical covariance structures. Such variance estimation relies on an exogeneity assumption akin to the standard unconfoundedness assumption invoked in observational studies. In simulation experiments, our methods are better at debiasing estimates than existing inverse propensity weighted estimators based on neighborhood exposure modeling. We use our method to reanalyze an experiment concerning weather insurance adoption conducted on a collection of villages in rural China.},

We performed a quantitative analysis of the nature and extent of the person-to-person spread of obesity as a possible factor contributing to the obesity epidemic. Methods We evaluated a densely interconnected social network of 12,067 people assessed repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. The bodymass index was available for all subjects. We used longitudinal statistical models to examine whether weight gain in one person was associated with weight gain in his or her friends, siblings, spouse, and neighbors. N Engl J Med 2007;357:370-9. Copyright {\copyright} 2007 Massachusetts Medical Society. Results Discernible clusters of obese persons were present in the network at all time points, and the clusters extended to three degrees of separation. These clusters did not appear to be solely attributable to the selective formation of social ties among obese persons. A person's chances of becoming obese increased by 57\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 123) if he or she had a friend who became obese in a given interval. Among pairs of adult siblings, if one sibling became obese, the chance that the other would become obese increased by 40\% (95\% CI, 21 to 60). If one spouse became obese, the likelihood that the other spouse would become obese increased by 37\% (95\% CI, 7 to 73). These effects were not seen among neighbors in the immediate geographic location. Persons of the same sex had relatively greater influence on each other as compared with those of the opposite sex. The spread of smoking cessation did not account for the spread of obesity in the network. Conclusions Network phenomena appear to be relevant to the biologic and behavioral trait of obesity, and obesity appears to spread through social ties. These findings have implications for clinical and public health interventions.},

However, classical causal inference approaches rely on independence assumptions that are violated by network interference, when the treatment of one individual influences the outcomes of others. All existing approaches require at least approximate knowledge of the network, which may be unavailable or costly to collect. We consider the task of estimating the total treatment effect (TTE), the average difference between the outcomes when the whole population is treated versus when the whole population is untreated. By leveraging a staggered rollout design, in which treatment is incrementally given to random subsets of individuals, we derive unbiased estimators for TTE that do not rely on any prior structural knowledge of the network, as long as the network interference effects are constrained to low-degree interactions among neighbors of an individual. We derive bounds on the variance of the estimators, and we show in experiments that our estimator performs well against baselines on simulated data. Central to our theoretical contribution is a connection between staggered rollout observations and polynomial extrapolation.},

However, it poses a challenge to estimating causal effects. We consider the task of estimating the total treatment effect (TTE), or the difference between the average outcomes of the population when everyone is treated versus when no one is, under network interference. Under a Bernoulli randomized design, we provide an unbiased estimator for the TTE when network interference effects are constrained to low order interactions among neighbors of an individual. We make no assumptions on the graph other than bounded degree, allowing for well-connected networks that may not be easily clustered. We derive a bound on the variance of our estimator and show in simulated experiments that it performs well compared with standard estimators for the TTE. We also derive a minimax lower bound on the mean squared error of our estimator which suggests that the difficulty of estimation can be characterized by the degree of interactions in the potential outcomes model. We also prove that our estimator is asymptotically normal under boundedness conditions on the network degree and potential outcomes model. Central to our contribution is a new framework for balancing model flexibility and statistical complexity as captured by this low order interactions structure.},

Recent work with low-order potential outcomes models uses a rollout design to obtain unbiased estimators that require no interference network information. However, the required extrapolation can lead to prohibitively high variance. To address this, we propose a two-stage experiment that selects a sub-population in the first stage and restricts treatment rollout to this sub-population in the second stage. We explore the role of clustering in the first stage by analyzing the bias and variance of a polynomial interpolation-style estimator under this experimental design. Bias increases with the number of edges cut in the clustering of the interference network, but variance depends on qualities of the clustering that relate to homophily and covariate balance. There is a tension between clustering objectives that minimize the number of cut edges versus those that maximize covariate balance across clusters. Through simulations, we explore a bias-variance trade-off and compare the performance of the estimator under different clustering strategies.},

Under a slightly more restrictive framework than Lee (2007), we show that this model is generally identified when at least three different sizes of peer groups are observed in the sample at hand. While unnecessary in general, homoscedasticity may be required in special cases, for instance when endogenous and exogenous peer effects cancel each other. We extend this analysis to the case where only binary outcomes are observed. Once more, most parameters are semiparametrically identified under weak conditions. However, identifying all of them requires more stringent assumptions, including a homoscedasticity condition. We also develop a parametric estimator for the binary case, which relies on the Geweke-HajivassiliouKeane (GHK) simulator.

Given some approximations to a cluster of neighboring eigenvalues and to the corresponding eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix, and given an estimate for the gap that separates the cluster from all other eigenvalues, how much can the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors differ from the subspace spanned by our approximations? These questions are closely related; both are investigated here. The difference between the two subspaces is characterized in terms of certain angles through which one subspace must be rotated in order most directly to reach the other. These angles unify the treatment of natural geometric, operator-theoretic and error-analytic questions concerning those subspaces. Sharp bounds upon trigonometric functions of these angles are obtained from the gap and from bounds upon either the perturbation (1st question) or a computable residual (2nd question). An example is included.},

Yet, the prevalent edge dependency poses a significant methodological challenge. Most existing methods are model-based and come with stringent assumptions, limiting their applicability. In response, we introduce a novel, fully nonparametric framework that requires only minimal regularity assumptions. While inspired by recent developments in \$U\$-statistic literature (arXiv:1712.00771, arXiv:2004.06615), our approach notably broadens their scopes. Specifically, we identified and carefully addressed the challenge of indeterminate degeneracy in the test statistics \$-\$ a problem that aforementioned tools do not handle. We established Berry-Esseen type bound for the accuracy of type-I error rate control. Using original analysis, we also proved the minimax optimality of our test's power. Simulations underscore the superiority of our method in computation speed, accuracy, and numerical robustness compared to competing methods. We also applied our method to the U.S. faculty hiring network data and discovered intriguing findings.},

Many scholars consider the commonly used assumption of no omitted confounders to be untenable due to contextual confounding and homophily bias. To address this long-standing problem, we examine the causal identification under a new assumption of structural stationarity, which formalizes the underlying diffusion process with a class of dynamic causal directed acyclic graphs. First, we develop a statistical test that can detect a wide range of biases, including the two types mentioned above. We then propose a difference-in-differences style estimator that can directly correct biases under an additional parametric assumption. Leveraging the proposed methods, we study the spatial diffusion of hate crimes against refugees in Germany. After correcting large upward bias in existing studies, we find hate crimes diffuse only to areas that have a high proportion of school dropouts.},

However, it is well known that identification and estimation of causal peer effects are challenging in observational studies for two reasons. The first is the identification challenge due to unmeasured network confounding, for example, homophily bias and contextual confounding. The second issue is network dependence of observations, which one must take into account for valid statistical inference. Negative control variables, also known as placebo variables, have been widely used in observational studies including peer effect analysis over networks, although they have been used primarily for bias detection. In this article, we establish a formal framework which leverages a pair of negative control outcome and exposure variables (double negative controls) to nonparametrically identify causal peer effects in the presence of unmeasured network confounding. We then propose a generalized method of moments estimator for causal peer effects, and establish its consistency and asymptotic normality under an assumption about {$\psi$}-network dependence. Finally, we provide a network heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent variance estimator. Our methods are illustrated with an application to peer effects in education.},

This provides for the first time an objective measure of whether or not a particular value of modularity is meaningful. In particular, our results quantify the strength of the relation between observed community structure and the interactions in a network. Our technical contribution is to provide limit theorems for modularity when a community assignment is given by nodal features or covariates. These theorems hold for a broad class of network models over a range of sparsity regimes, as well as for weighted, multiedge, and power-law networks. This allows us to assign p-values to observed community structure, which we validate using several benchmark examples from the literature. We conclude by applying this methodology to investigate a multiedge network of corporate email interactions.},

  abstract = {Variance reduction for causal inference in the presence of network interference is often achieved through either outcome modeling, which is typically analyzed under unit-randomized Bernoulli designs, or clustered experimental designs, which are typically analyzed without strong parametric assumptions. In this work, we study the intersection of these two approaches and consider the problem of estimation in low-order outcome models using data from a general experimental design. Our contributions are threefold. First, we present an estimator of the total treatment effect (also called the global average treatment effect) in low-order outcome models when the data are collected under general experimental designs, generalizing previous results for Bernoulli designs. We refer to this estimator as the pseudoinverse estimator and give bounds on its bias and variance in terms of properties of the experimental design. Second, we evaluate these bounds for the case of cluster randomized designs with both Bernoulli and complete randomization. For clustered Bernoulli randomization, we find that our estimator is always unbiased and that its variance scales like the smaller of the variance obtained from a low-order assumption and the variance obtained from cluster randomization, showing that combining these variance reduction strategies is preferable to using either individually. For clustered complete randomization, we find a notable bias-variance trade-off mediated by specific features of the clustering. Third, when choosing a clustered experimental design, our bounds can be used to select a clustering from a set of candidate clusterings. Across a range of graphs and clustering algorithms, we show that our method consistently selects clusterings that perform well on a range of response models, suggesting that our bounds are useful to practitioners.},

  abstract = {From a policy standpoint the spread of health conditions in social networks is important to quantify, because it implies externalities and possible market failures in the consumption of health interventions. Recent studies conclude that happiness and depression may be highly contagious across social ties. The results may be biased, however, due to selection and common shocks. We provide unbiased estimates by using exogenous variation from college roommate assignments. Our findings are consistent with no significant overall contagion of mental health and no more than small contagion effects for specific mental health measures, with no evidence for happiness contagion and modest evidence for anxiety and depression contagion. The weakness of the contagion effects cannot be explained by avoidance of roommates with poor mental health or by generally low social contact among roommates. We also find that similarity of baseline mental health predicts the closeness of roommate relationships, which highlights the potential for selection biases in studies of peer effects that do not have a clearly exogenous source of variation. Overall our results suggest that mental health contagion is lower, or at least more context-specific, than implied by the recent studies in the medical literature.},

  abstract = {Causal inference on a population of units connected through a network often presents technical challenges, including how to account for interference. In the presence of interference, for instance, potential outcomes of a unit depend on their treatment as well as on the treatments of other units, such as their neighbors in the network. In observational studies, a further complication is that the typical unconfoundedness assumption must be extended---say, to include the treatment of neighbors, and individual and neighborhood covariates---to guarantee identification and valid inference. Here, we propose new estimands that define treatment and interference effects. We then derive analytical expressions for the bias of a naive estimator that wrongly assumes away interference. The bias depends on the level of interference but also on the degree of association between individual and neighborhood treatments. We propose an extended unconfoundedness assumption that accounts for interference, and we develop new covariateadjustment methods that lead to valid estimates of treatment and interference effects in observational studies on networks. Estimation is based on a generalized propensity score that balances individual and neighborhood covariates across units under different levels of individual treatment and of exposure to neighbors' treatment. We carry out simulations, calibrated using friendship networks and covariates in a nationally representative longitudinal study of adolescents in grades 7--12 in the United States, to explore finite-sample performance in different realistic settings.

The essential idea underlying this generalization is to examine the impact on the precision of estimation--in particular, the size of an ellipsoidal joint confidence region for {$\beta$}1--of less-than-optimal selection of other columns of the design matrix (X2), treating still other columns (X0) as unalterable, even hypothetically. In typical applications, X1 contains a set of dummy regressors coding categories of a qualitative variable or a set of polynomial regressors in a quantitative variable; X2 contains all other regressors in the model, save the constant, which is in X0. If {$\sigma$}2V denotes the realized variance of \${\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{{\textbackslash}beta\}\}\_1\$ and {$\sigma$}2U is the variance associated with an optimal selection of X2, then the corresponding scaled dispersion ellipsoids to be compared are EV = \{x : x'V-1x {$\leq$} 1\} and EU = \{x : x'U-1 x {$\leq$} 1\}, where EU is contained in EV. The two ellipsoids can be compared by considering the radii of EV relative to EU, obtained through the spectral decomposition to V relative to U. We proceed to explore the geometry of generalized variance inflation, to show the relationship of these measures to correlation-matrix determinants and canonical correlations, to consider X matrices structured by relations of marginality among regressor subspaces, to develop the relationship of generalized variance inflation to hypothesis tests in the multivariate normal linear model, and to present several examples.},

We provide empirical illustration, showing how to calculate and present spatial effect estimates effectively, using data on European governments' active labor market expenditures. Our main conclusions are that spatial OLS, despite its simultaneity, performs acceptably under low-to-moderate interdependence strength and reasonable sample dimensions. Spatial 2SLS or spatial ML may be advised for other conditions, but, unless interdependence is truly absent or minuscule, any of the spatial estimators unambiguously, and often dramatically, dominates on all three criteria the nonspatial OLS commonly used currently in empirical work in political science.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider data consisting of multiple networks, each composed of a different edge set on a common set of nodes. Many models have been proposed for the analysis of such multiview network data under the assumption that the data views are closely related. In this paper, we provide tools for evaluating this assumption. In particular, we ask: given two networks that each follow a stochastic block model, is there an association between the latent community memberships of the nodes in the two networks? To answer this question, we extend the stochastic block model for a single network view to the two-view setting, and develop a new hypothesis test for the null hypothesis that the latent community memberships in the two data views are independent. We apply our test to protein--protein interaction data from the HINT database. We find evidence of a weak association between the latent community memberships of proteins defined with respect to binary interaction data and the latent community memberships of proteins defined with respect to cocomplex association data. We also extend this proposal to the setting of a network with node covariates. The proposed methods extend readily to three or more network/multivariate data views.},

This setting is often referred to as ``spatial confounding.'' We consider spline models, Gaussian processes (GP), generalized least squares (GLS), and restricted spatial regression (RSR) under two data generation processes: one where the confounder is a fixed effect and one where it is a random effect. The literature on spatial confounding is confusing and contradictory, and our results correct and clarify several misunderstandings. We first show that, like an unadjusted OLS estimator, RSR is asymptotically biased under any spatial confounding scenario. We then prove a novel result on the consistency of the GLS estimator under spatial confounding. We finally prove that estimators like GLS, GP, and splines, that are consistent under confounding by a fixed effect will also be consistent under confounding by a random effect. We conclude that, contrary to much of the recent literature on spatial confounding, traditional estimators based on partially linear models are amenable to estimating effects in the presence of spatial confounding. We support our theoretical arguments with simulation studies.},

Unfortunately, the complicated dependence structure of network data presents an obstacle to many causal inference procedures. We consider the task of mediation analysis for network data, and present a model in which mediation occurs in a latent embedding space. Under this model, node-level interventions have causal effects on nodal outcomes, and these effects can be partitioned into a direct effect independent of the network, and an indirect effect induced by homophily. To estimate network-mediated effects, we embed nodes into a low-dimensional space and fit two regression models: (1) an outcome model describing how nodal outcomes vary with treatment, controls, and position in latent space; and (2) a mediator model describing how latent positions vary with treatment and controls. We prove that the estimated coefficients are asymptotically normal about the true coefficients under a sub-gamma generalization of the random dot product graph, a widely-used latent space model. We show that these coefficients can be used in product-of-coefficients estimators for causal inference. Our method is easy to implement, scales to networks with millions of edges, and can be extended to accommodate a variety of structured data.},

However, even when peer effects are identified, they may not be estimable, due to an asymptotic colinearity issue: as sample size increases, peer effects become more and more linearly dependent. We show that asymptotic colinearity occurs whenever nodal covariates are independent of the network and the minimum degree of the network is growing. Asymptotic colinearity can cause estimators to be inconsistent or to converge at slower than expected rates. We also demonstrate that dependence between nodal covariates and network structure can alleviate colinearity issues in random dot product graphs. These results suggest that linear-in-means models are less reliable for studying peer influence than previously believed.},

When there are unobserved factors that affect both friendship decisions and economic outcomes, the spatial weight matrix (sociomatrix; adjacency matrix) in the SAR model, which represents the structure of a friendship network, might correlate with the disturbance term of the model, and consequently result in an endogenous selection problem in the outcomes. We consider this problem of selection bias with a modeling approach. In this approach, a statistical network model is adopted to explain the endogenous network formation process. By specifying unobserved components in both the network model and the SAR model, we capture the correlation between the processes of network and outcome formation, and propose a proper estimation procedure for the system. We demonstrate that the estimation of this system can be effectively done by using the Bayesian method. We provide a Monte Carlo experiment and an empirical application of this modeling approach on the friendship networks of high school students and their interactions on academic performance in the Add Health data.

All students selected had been living with randomly assigned roommates for at least 10 weeks. Depressive symptoms, perceptions, and rejection were assessed in the roommates of these students 2-7 days after the initial screening. Roommates of students depressed in conjunction with other psychological disturbance were significantly more depressed themselves on two different measures than were roommates of students in the other three groups. Rejection was suggested by a disproportionately high incidence of roommate breakups involving students with this profile type. Roommates who remained with these students also differed from roommates in the other three conditions in their inability to simulate accurately students' earlier responses to the MMPI depression scale. The severity and/or nature of overall psychological dysfunction, rather than depression per se, may be central to the experiences of significant others.},

For any membership estimation \${\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}pi\}\_i, 1 {\textbackslash}leq i {\textbackslash}leq n{\textbackslash}\}\$, since each \${\textbackslash}pi\_i\$ is a probability mass function, it is natural to measure the errors by the average \${\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}1\$-norm {\textbackslash}[ {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{n\} {\textbackslash}sum\_\{i = 1\}{\textasciicircum}n {\textbackslash}{\textbar} {\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}pi\}\_i - {\textbackslash}pi\_i{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\_1. {\textbackslash}] We also consider a variant of the \${\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}1\$-loss, where each \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}pi\}\_i - {\textbackslash}pi\_i{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\_1\$ is re-weighted by the degree parameter \${\textbackslash}theta\_i\$ in DCMM (to be introduced). We present a sharp lower bound. We also show that such a lower bound is achievable under a broad situation. More discussion in this vein is continued in our forthcoming manuscript. The results are very different from those on community detection. For community detection, the focus is on the special case where all \${\textbackslash}pi\_i\$ are degenerate; the goal is clustering, so Hamming distance is the natural choice of loss function, and the rate can be exponentially fast. The setting here is broader and more difficult: it is more natural to use the \${\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}1\$-loss, and the rate is only polynomially fast.},

  abstract = {In economics and social science, network data are regularly observed, and a thorough understanding of the network community structure facilitates the comprehension of economic patterns and activities. Consider an undirected network with n nodes and K communities. We model the network using the Degree-Corrected Mixed-Membership (DCMM) model, where for each node i=1,2,{\dots},n, there exists a membership vector {$\pi$}i=({$\pi$}i(1),{$\pi$}i(2),{\dots},{$\pi$}i(K)){$\prime$}, where {$\pi$}i(k) is the weight that node i puts on community k, 1{$\leq$}k{$\leq$}K. In comparison to the well-known stochastic block model (SBM), the DCMM permits both severe degree heterogeneity and mixed memberships, making it more realistic and general. We present an efficient approach, Mixed-SCORE, for estimating the mixed membership vectors of all nodes and the other DCMM parameters. This approach is inspired by the discovery of a delicate simplex structure in the spectral domain. We derive explicit error rates for the Mixed-SCORE algorithm and demonstrate that it is rate-optimal over a broad parameter space. Our findings provide a novel statistical tool for network community analysis, which can be used to understand network formations, extract nodal features, identify unobserved covariates in dyadic regressions, and estimate peer effects. We applied Mixed-SCORE to a political blog network, two trade networks, a co-authorship network, and a citee network, and obtained interpretable results.},

  abstract = {A fundamental problem in network experiments is selecting an appropriate experimental design in order to precisely estimate a given causal effect of interest. In fact, optimal rates of estimation remain unknown for essentially all causal effects in network experiments. In this work, we propose a general approach for constructing experiment designs under network interference with the goal of precisely estimating a pre-specified causal effect. A central aspect of our approach is the notion of a conflict graph, which captures the fundamental unobservability associated with the casual effect and the underlying network. We refer to our experimental design as the Conflict Graph Design. In order to estimate effects, we propose a modified Horvitz--Thompson estimator. We show that its variance under the Conflict Graph Design is bounded as O({$\lambda$}(H)/n), where {$\lambda$}(H) is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the conflict graph. These rates depend on both the underlying network and the particular causal effect under investigation. Not only does this yield the best known rates of estimation for several well-studied causal effects (e.g. the global and direct effects) but it also provides new methods for effects which have received less attention from the perspective of experiment design (e.g. spill-over effects). Our results corroborate two implicitly understood points in the literature: (1) that in order to increase precision, experiment designs should be tailored to specific causal effects of interest and (2) that ``more local'' effects are easier to estimate than ``more global'' effects. In addition to point estimation, we construct conservative variance estimators which facilitate the construction of asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the casual effect of interest.},

Most blockmodels, however, ignore variation in vertex degree, making them unsuitable for applications to real-world networks, which typically display broad degree distributions that can significantly distort the results. Here we demonstrate how the generalization of blockmodels to incorporate this missing element leads to an improved objective function for community detection in complex networks. We also propose a heuristic algorithm for community detection using this objective function or its non-degree-corrected counterpart and show that the degree-corrected version dramatically outperforms the uncorrected one in both real-world and synthetic networks.},

We systematically investigate the optimality properties of H-T estimator under network interference, by embedding it in the class of all linear estimators. In particular, we show that in presence of any kind of network interference, H-T estimator is in-admissible in the class of all linear estimators when using a completely randomized and a Bernoulli design. We also show that the H-T estimator becomes admissible under certain restricted randomization schemes termed as ``fixed exposure designs''. We give examples of such fixed exposure designs. It is well known that the H-T estimator is unbiased when correct weights are specified. Here, we derive the weights for unbiased estimation of various causal effects, and illustrate how they depend not only on the design, but more importantly, on the assumed form of interference (which in many real world situations is unknown at design stage), and the causal effect of interest.},

  abstract = {In the last two decades, considerable research has been devoted to a phenomenon known as spatial confounding. Spatial confounding is thought to occur when there is collinearity between a covariate and the random effect in a spatial regression model. This collinearity is considered highly problematic when the inferential goal is est-imating regression coefficients, and various methodologies have been proposed to ``alleviate'' it. Recently, it has become apparent that many of these methodologies are flawed, yet the field continues to expand. In this paper, we offer the first attempt to synthesize work in the field of spatial confounding. We propose that there are at least two distinct phenomena currently conflated with the term spatial confounding. We refer to these as the analysis model and the data generation types of spatial confounding. We show that these two issues can lead to contradicting conclusions about whether spatial confounding exists and whether methods to alleviate it will improve inference. Our results also illustrate that in most cases, traditional spatial linear mixed models do help to improve inference of regression coefficients. Drawing on the insights gained, we offer a path forward for research in spatial confounding.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with cross-sectional dependence arising because observations are interconnected through an observed network. Following (Doukhan and Louhichi, 1999), we measure the strength of dependence by covariances of nonlinearly transformed variables. We provide a law of large numbers and central limit theorem for network dependent variables. We also provide a method of calculating standard errors robust to general forms of network dependence. For that purpose, we rely on a network heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) variance estimator, and show its consistency. The results rely on conditions characterized by tradeoffs between the rate of decay of dependence across a network and network's denseness. Our approach can accommodate data generated by network formation models, random fields on graphs, conditional dependency graphs, and large functional-causal systems of equations.},

We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues.                        ,                             Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008)               BMJ               337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.},

We significantly expand the scope of the existing literature by allowing for endogenous time-varying spatial weight matrices without imposing explicit structural assumptions on how the weights are formed. An important area of application is in social interaction and network models where our specification can accommodate data dependent network formation. We consider an exemplary social interaction model and show how identification of the interaction parameters is achieved through a combination of linear and quadratic moment conditions. For the general setup we develop an orthogonal forward differencing transformation to aid in the estimation of factor components while maintaining orthogonality of moment conditions. This is an important ingredient to a tractable asymptotic distribution of our estimators. In general, the asymptotic distribution of our estimators is found to be mixed normal due to random norming. However, the asymptotic distribution of our test statistics is still chi-square.},

  abstract = {We study linear peer effects models where peers interact in groups and individual's outcomes are linear in the group mean outcome and characteristics. We allow for unobserved random group effects as well as observed fixed group effects. The specification is in part motivated by the moment conditions imposed in Graham (2008). We show that these moment conditions can be cast in terms of a linear random group effects model and that they lead to a class of GMM estimators with parameters generally identified as long as there is sufficient variation in group size or group types. We also show that our class of GMM estimators contains a Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimator (QMLE) for the random group effects model, as well as the Wald estimator of Graham (2008) and the within estimator of Lee (2007) as special cases. Our identification results extend insights in Graham (2008) that show how assumptions about random group effects, variation in group size and certain forms of heteroscedasticity can be used to overcome the reflection problem in identifying peer effects. Our QMLE and GMM estimators accommodate additional covariates and are valid in situations with a large but finite number of different group sizes or types. Because our estimators are general moment based procedures, using instruments other than binary group indicators in estimation is straight forward. Our QMLE estimator accommodates group level covariates in the spirit of Mundlak and Chamberlain and offers an alternative to fixed effects specifications. This model feature significantly extends the applicability of Graham's identification strategy to situations where group assignment may not be random but correlation of group level effects with peer effects can be controlled for with observable group level characteristics. Monte-Carlo simulations show that the bias of the QMLE estimator decreases with the number of groups and the variation in group size, and increases with group size. We also prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator under reasonable assumptions.},

  abstract = {Complex systems in nature and in society are often represented as networks, describing the rich set of interactions between objects of interest. Many deterministic and probabilistic clustering methods have been developed to analyze such structures. Given a network, almost all of them partition the vertices into disjoint clusters, according to their connection profile. However, recent studies have shown that these techniques were too restrictive and that most of the existing networks contained overlapping clusters. To tackle this issue, we present in this paper the Overlapping Stochastic Block Model. Our approach allows the vertices to belong to multiple clusters, and, to some extent, generalizes the well-known Stochastic Block Model [Nowicki and Snijders (2001)]. We show that the model is generically identifiable within classes of equivalence and we propose an approximate inference procedure, based on global and local variational techniques. Using toy data sets as well as the French Political Blogosphere network and the transcriptional network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we compare our work with other approaches.},

  abstract = {Linear regression on network-linked observations has been an essential tool in modeling the relationship between response and covariates with additional network structures. Previous methods either lack inference tools or rely on restrictive assumptions on social effects and usually assume that networks are observed without errors. This paper proposes a regression model with nonparametric network effects. The model does not assume that the relational data or network structure is exactly observed and can be provably robust to network perturbations. Asymptotic inference framework is established under a general requirement of the network observational errors, and the robustness of this method is studied in the specific setting when the errors come from random network models. We discover a phase-transition phenomenon of the inference validity concerning the network density when no prior knowledge of the network model is available while also showing a significant improvement achieved by knowing the network model. Simulation studies are conducted to verify these theoretical results and demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing work in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency under different data-generating models. The method is then applied to middle school students' network data to study the effectiveness of educational workshops in reducing school conflicts.},

  abstract = {This paper studies causal inference in randomized experiments under network interference. Commonly used models of interference posit that treatments assigned to alters beyond a certain network distance from the ego have no effect on the ego's response. However, this assumption is violated in common models of social interactions. We propose a substantially weaker model of ``approximate neighborhood interference'' (ANI) under which treatments assigned to alters further from the ego have a smaller, but potentially nonzero, effect on the ego's response. We formally verify that ANI holds for well-known models of social interactions. Under ANI, restrictions on the network topology, and asymptotics under which the network size increases, we prove that standard inverse-probability weighting estimators consistently estimate useful exposure effects and are approximately normal. For inference, we consider a network HAC variance estimator. Under a finite population model, we show that the estimator is biased but that the bias can be interpreted as the variance of unit-level exposure effects. This generalizes Neyman's well-known result on conservative variance estimation to settings with interference.},

  abstract = {Since network data commonly consists of observations from a single large network, researchers often partition the network into clusters in order to apply cluster-robust inference methods. Existing such methods require clusters to be asymptotically independent. Under mild conditions, we prove that, for this requirement to hold for network-dependent data, it is necessary and sufficient that clusters have low conductance, the ratio of edge boundary size to volume. This yields a simple measure of cluster quality. We find in simulations that when clusters have low conductance, cluster-robust methods control size better than HAC estimators. However, for important classes of networks lacking low-conductance clusters, the former can exhibit substantial size distortion. To determine the number of low-conductance clusters and construct them, we draw on results in spectral graph theory that connect conductance to the spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Based on these results, we propose to use the spectrum to determine the number of low-conductance clusters and spectral clustering to construct them.},

In the process, we establish a finite-sample concentration inequality for the low-rank eigenvalue truncation of a random weighted adjacency matrix, which may be of independent interest.

  abstract = {Many previous causal inference studies require no interference, that is, the potential outcomes of a unit do not depend on the treatments of other units. However, this no-interference assumption becomes unreasonable when a unit interacts with other units in the same group or cluster. In a motivating application, a top Chinese university admits students through two channels: the college entrance exam (also known as Gaokao) and recommendation (often based on Olympiads in various subjects). The university randomly assigns students to dorms, each of which hosts four students. Students within the same dorm live together and have extensive interactions. Therefore, it is likely that peer effects exist and the no-interference assumption does not hold. It is important to understand peer effects, because they give useful guidance for future roommate assignment to improve the performance of students. We define peer effects using potential outcomes. We then propose a randomization-based inference framework to study peer effects with arbitrary numbers of peers and peer types. Our inferential procedure does not assume any parametric model on the outcome distribution. Our analysis gives useful practical guidance for policy makers of the university.

This model has recently gained popularity as means of incorporating interference effects into the Neyman--Rubin potential outcomes framework; and several authors have considered estimation of various causal targets, including the direct and indirect effects of treatment. In this paper, we consider large-sample asymptotics for treatment effect estimation under network interference in a setting where the exposure graph is a random draw from a graphon. When targeting the direct effect, we show that---in our setting---popular estimators are considerably more accurate than existing results suggest, and provide a central limit theorem in terms of moments of the graphon. Meanwhile, when targeting the indirect effect, we leverage our generative assumptions to propose a consistent estimator in a setting where no other consistent estimators are currently available. We also show how our results can be used to conduct a practical assessment of the sensitivity of randomized study inference to potential interference effects. Overall, our results highlight the promise of random graph asymptotics in understanding the practicality and limits of causal inference under network interference.},

  abstract = {We consider basic conceptual questions concerning the relationship between statistical estimation and causal inference. Firstly, we show how to translate causal inference problems into an abstract statistical formalism without requiring any structure beyond an arbitrarily-indexed family of probability models. The formalism is simple but can incorporate a variety of causal modelling frameworks, including `structural causal models', but also models expressed in terms of, e.g., differential equations. We focus primarily on the structural/graphical causal modelling literature, however. Secondly, we consider the extent to which causal and statistical concerns can be cleanly separated, examining the fundamental question: `What can be estimated from data?'. We call this the problem of estimability. We approach this by analysing a standard formal definition of `can be estimated' commonly adopted in the causal inference literature -- identifiability -- in our abstract statistical formalism. We use elementary category theory to show that identifiability implies the existence of a Fisher-consistent estimator, but also show that this estimator may be discontinuous, and thus unstable, in general. This difficulty arises because the causal inference problem is, in general, an ill-posed inverse problem. Inverse problems have three conditions which must be satisfied to be considered well-posed: existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions. Here identifiability corresponds to the question of uniqueness; in contrast, we take estimability to mean satisfaction of all three conditions, i.e. well-posedness. Lack of stability implies that naive translation of a causally identifiable quantity into an achievable statistical estimation target may prove impossible. Our article is primarily expository and aimed at unifying ideas from multiple fields, though we provide new constructions and proofs.},

If the network grows according to either a latent community (stochastic block) model, or a continuous latent space model, then latent homophilous attributes can be consistently estimated from the global pattern of social ties. We show that, for common versions of those two network models, these estimates are so informative that controlling for estimated attributes allows for asymptotically unbiased and consistent estimation of social-influence effects in linear models. In particular, the bias shrinks at a rate that directly reflects how much information the network provides about the latent attributes. These are the first results on the consistent nonexperimental estimation of social-influence effects in the presence of latent homophily, and we discuss the prospects for generalizing them.},

We analyze anonymized individual-level observational data from 3 TCs that kept records of written exchanges of affirmations and corrections among residents, and their precise entry and exit dates. The affirmations allow us to form peer networks, and the entry and exit dates allow us to define a causal effect of interest. We conceptualize the causal role model effect as measuring the difference in the expected outcome of a resident (ego) who can observe one of their social contacts (e.g., peers who gave affirmations), to be successful in graduating before the ego's exit vs not successfully graduating before the ego's exit. Since peer influence is usually confounded with unobserved homophily in observational data, we model the network with a latent variable model to estimate homophily and include it in the outcome equation. We provide a theoretical guarantee that the bias of our peer influence estimator decreases with sample size. Our results indicate there is an effect of peers' graduation on the graduation of residents. The magnitude of peer influence differs based on gender, race, and the definition of the role model effect. A counterfactual exercise quantifies the potential benefits of intervention of assigning a buddy to ``at-risk'' individuals directly on the treated resident and indirectly on their peers through network propagation.},

We use causal diagrams to distinguish among three causal mechanisms that give rise to interference. The first causal mechanism by which interference can operate is a direct causal effect of one individual's treatment on another individual's outcome; we call this direct interference. Interference by contagion is present when one individual's outcome may affect the outcomes of other individuals with whom he comes into contact. Then giving treatment to the first individual could have an indirect effect on others through the treated individual's outcome. The third pathway by which interference may operate is allocational interference. Treatment in this case allocates individuals to groups; through interactions within a group, individuals may affect one another's outcomes in any number of ways. In many settings, more than one type of interference will be present simultaneously. The causal effects of interest differ according to which types of interference are present, as do the conditions under which causal effects are identifiable. Using causal diagrams for interference, we describe these differences, give criteria for the identification of important causal effects, and discuss applications to infectious diseases.},

Appropriate methods don't (yet!) exist, so researchers hoping to learn about contagion from observational social network data are sometimes faced with a dilemma: they can abandon their research program, or they can use inappropriate methods. This chapter will focus on the challenges and the open problems and will not weigh in on that dilemma, except to mention here that the most responsible way to use any statistical method, especially when it is well-known that the assumptions on which it rests do not hold, is with a healthy dose of skepticism, with honest acknowledgment and deep understanding of the limitations, and with copious caveats about how to interpret the results.},

We present a social network model of peer effects with ex ante heterogeneous agents and show how conformism and deterrence affect criminal activities. We then bring the model to the data by using a very detailed data set of adolescent friendship networks. A novel social network--based empirical strategy allows us to identify peer effects for different types of crimes. We find that conformity plays an important role for all crimes, especially for petty crimes. This suggests that, for juvenile crime, an effective policy should be measured not only by the possible crime reduction it implies but also by the group interactions it engenders.},

This allows for quickly sampling from a broad class of stochastic blockmodel graphs (degree-corrected, mixed membership, overlapping) all of which are specific parameterizations of the generalized random product graph model defined in Section 2.2. The basic idea of fastRG is to first sample the number of edges m and then sample each edge. The key insight is that because of the the low rank expectation, it is easy to sample individual edges. The naive ``element-wise'' algorithm requires O(n2) operations to generate the n {\texttimes} n adjacency matrix A. In sparse graphs, where m = O(n), ignoring log terms, fastRG runs in time O(n). An implementation in R is available on github. A computational experiment in Section 2.4 simulates graphs up to n = 10, 000, 000 nodes with m = 100, 000, 000 edges. For example, on a graph with n = 500, 000 and m = 5, 000, 000, fastRG runs in less than one second on a 3.5 GHz Intel i5.},

  abstract = {Psychologists developed Multiple Factor Analysis to decompose multivariate data into a small number of interpretable factors without any a priori knowledge about those factors [Thurstone, 1935]. In this form of factor analysis, the Varimax ``factor rotation'' is a key step to make the factors interpretable [Kaiser, 1958]. Charles Spearman and many others objected to factor rotations because the factors seem to be rotationally invariant [Thurstone, 1947, Anderson and Rubin, 1956]. These objections are still reported in all contemporary multivariate statistics textbooks. This is an engima because this vintage form of factor analysis has survived and is widely popular because, empirically, the factor rotation often makes the factors easier to interpret. We argue that the rotation makes the factors easier to interpret because, in fact, the Varimax factor rotation performs statistical inference. We show that Principal Components Analysis (PCA) with the Varimax rotation provides a unified spectral estimation strategy for a broad class of modern factor models, including the Stochastic Blockmodel and a natural variation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (i.e., ``topic modeling''). In addition, we show that Thurstone's widely employed sparsity diagnostics implicitly assess a key ``leptokurtic'' condition that makes the rotation statistically identifiable in these models. Taken together, this shows that the know-how of Vintage Factor Analysis performs statistical inference, reversing nearly a century of statistical thinking on the topic. With a sparse eigensolver, PCA with Varimax is both fast and stable. Combined with Thurstone's straightforward diagnostics, this vintage approach is suitable for a wide array of modern applications.},

  abstract = {Spectral embedding is a procedure which can be used to obtain vector representations of the nodes of a graph. This paper proposes a generalisation of the latent position network model known as the random dot product graph, to allow interpretation of those vector representations as latent position estimates. The generalisation is needed to model heterophilic connectivity (e.g. `opposites attract') and to cope with negative eigenvalues more generally. We show that, whether the adjacency or normalised Laplacian matrix is used, spectral embedding produces uniformly consistent latent position estimates with asymptotically Gaussian error (up to identifiability). The standard and mixed membership stochastic block models are special cases in which the latent positions take only K distinct vector values, representing communities, or live in the (K - 1)-simplex with those vertices respectively. Under the stochastic block model, our theory suggests spectral clustering using a Gaussian mixture model (rather than K-means) and, under mixed membership, fitting the minimum volume enclosing simplex, existing recommendations previously only supported under non-negative-definite assumptions. Empirical improvements in link prediction (over the random dot product graph), and the potential to uncover richer latent structure (than posited under the standard or mixed membership stochastic block models) are demonstrated in a cyber-security example.},

The authors show that generically, all of these are confounded with each other. Distinguishing them from one another requires strong assumptions on the parametrization of the social process or on the adequacy of the covariates used (or both). In particular the authors demonstrate, with simple examples, that asymmetries in regression coefficients cannot identify causal effects and that very simple models of imitation (a form of social contagion) can produce substantial correlations between an individual's enduring traits and his or her choices, even when there is no intrinsic affinity between them. The authors also suggest some possible constructive responses to these results.},

It is the largest encyclopedia ever created, with millions of users worldwide relying on it as the first source of information as well as for fact-checking and in-depth research. As Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of its volunteer editors, its success might be particularly affected by toxic speech. In this paper, we analyze all 57 million comments made on user talk pages of 8.5 million editors across the six most active language editions of Wikipedia to study the potential impact of toxicity on editors' behavior. We find that toxic comments are consistently associated with reduced activity of editors, equivalent to 0.5--2 active days per user in the short term. This translates to multiple human-years of lost productivity, considering the number of active contributors to Wikipedia. The effects of toxic comments are potentially even greater in the long term, as they are associated with a significantly increased risk of editors leaving the project altogether. Using an agent-based model, we demonstrate that toxicity attacks on Wikipedia have the potential to impede the progress of the entire project. Our results underscore the importance of mitigating toxic speech on collaborative platforms such as Wikipedia to ensure their continued success.},

  abstract = {We propose an easy-to-use adjustment estimator for the effect of a treatment based on observational data from a single (social) network of units. The approach allows for interactions among units within the network, called interference, and for observed confounding. We define a simplified causal graph that does not differentiate between units, called generic graph. Using valid adjustment sets determined in the generic graph, we can identify the treatment effect and build a corresponding estimator. We establish the estimator's consistency and its convergence to a Gaussian limiting distribution at the parametric rate under certain regularity conditions that restrict the growth of dependencies among units. We empirically verify the theoretical properties of our estimator through a simulation study and apply it to estimate the effect of a strict facial-mask policy on the spread of COVID-19 in Switzerland.},

For example, how soon will a person start playing a game given that his/her friends like it? Studying social network dependence is an emerging research area. In this work, we propose a novel latent spatial autocorrelation Cox model to study social network dependence with time-to-event data. The proposed model introduces a latent indicator to characterize whether a person's survival time might be affected by his or her friends' features. We first propose a score-type test for detecting the existence of social network dependence. If it exists, we further develop an EM-type algorithm to estimate the model parameters. The performance of the proposed test and estimators are illustrated by simulation studies and an application to a time-to-event dataset about playing a popular mobile game from one of the largest online social network platforms.

We discuss the change in the interpretation of the regression coefficients in Restricted Network Regression and analytically characterize the effect of Restricted Network Regression on the regression coefficients for continuous response data. We show through simulation with continuous and binary response data that Restricted Network Regression mitigates, but does not alleviate, network confounding, by providing improved estimation of the regression coefficients.

  abstract = {In the context of spatial regression analysis, several methods can be used to control for the statistical effects of spatial dependencies among observations. Maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches account for spatial dependencies in a parametric framework, whereas recent spatial filtering approaches focus on nonparametrically removing spatial autocorrelation. In this paper we propose a semiparametric spatial filtering approach that allows researchers to deal explicitly with (a) spatially lagged autoregressive models and (b) simultaneous autoregressive spatial models. As in one nonparametric spatial filtering approach, a specific subset of eigenvectors from a transformed spatial link matrix is used to capture dependencies among the disturbances of a spatial regression model. However, the optimal subset in the proposed filtering model is identified more intuitively by an objective function that minimizes spatial autocorrelation rather than maximizes a model fit. The proposed objective function has the advantage that it leads to a robust and smaller subset of selected eigenvectors. An application of the proposed eigenvector spatial filtering approach, which uses a cancer mortality dataset for the 508 US State Economic Areas, demonstrates its feasibility, flexibility, and simplicity.},

This monograph offers an invitation to the field of matrix concentration inequalities. It begins with some history of random matrix theory; it describes a flexible model for random matrices that is suitable for many problems; and it discusses the most important matrix concentration results.

A drawback with A/B testing is that it is poorly suited for experiments involving social interference, when the treatment of individuals spills over to neighboring individuals along an underlying social network. In this work, we propose a novel methodology using graph clustering to analyze average treatment effects under social interference. To begin, we characterize graph-theoretic conditions under which individuals can be considered to be `network exposed' to an experiment. We then show how graph cluster randomization admits an efficient exact algorithm to compute the probabilities for each vertex being network exposed under several of these exposure conditions. Using these probabilities as inverse weights, a Horvitz-Thompson estimator can then provide an effect estimate that is unbiased, provided that the exposure model has been properly specified.},

Individuals exert ``contagion effects'' on one another through social ties and association. These analyses have come under critique because of the possibility that homophily from unmeasured factors may explain these statistical associations and because similar findings can be obtained when the same methodology is applied to height, acne, and headaches, for which the conclusion of contagion effects seems somewhat less plausible. The author uses sensitivity analysis techniques to assess the extent to which supposed contagion effects for obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness might be explained away by homophily or confounding and the extent to which the critique using analysis of data on height, acne, and headaches is relevant. Sensitivity analyses suggest that contagion effects for obesity and smoking cessation are reasonably robust to possible latent homophily or environmental confounding; those for happiness and loneliness are somewhat less so. Supposed effects for height, acne, and headaches are all easily explained away by latent homophily and confounding. The methodology that has been used in past studies for contagion effects in social networks, when used in conjunction with sensitivity analysis, may prove useful in establishing social influence for various behaviors and states. The sensitivity analysis approach can be used to address the critique of latent homophily as a possible explanation of associations interpreted as contagion effects.},

In the simple setting of a randomized vaccine trial with households of size two, we use counterfactual theory under interference to provide formal definitions of a contagion effect and an unconditional infectiousness effect. Using ideas analogous to mediation analysis, we show that the indirect effect (the effect of one person's vaccine on another's outcome) can be decomposed into a contagion effect and an unconditional infectiousness effect on the risk-difference, risk-ratio, odds-ratio and vaccine-efficacy scales. We provide identification assumptions for such contagion and unconditional infectiousness effects, and describe a simple statistical technique to estimate these effects when they are identified. We also give a sensitivity-analysis technique to assess how inferences would change under violations of the identification assumptions.

I propose nonparametric estimators for average direct and spillover effects that overcome these issues and are consistent and asymptotically normal under a precise relationship between the number of parameters of interest, the total sample size and the treatment assignment mechanism. These findings are illustrated using data from a conditional cash transfer program and with simulations. The empirical results reveal the potential pitfalls of failing to flexibly account for spillover effects in policy evaluation: the estimated difference in means and the reduced-form linear-in-means coefficients are all close to zero and statistically insignificant, whereas the nonparametric estimators I propose reveal large, nonlinear and significant spillover effects.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the design of cluster experiments to estimate the global treatment effect in the presence of network spillovers. We provide a framework to choose the clustering that minimizes the worst-case mean-squared error of the estimated global effect. We show that optimal clustering solves a novel penalized min-cut optimization problem computed via off-the-shelf semi-definite programming algorithms. Our analysis also characterizes simple conditions to choose between any two cluster designs, including choosing between a cluster or individual-level randomization. We illustrate the method's properties using unique network data from the universe of Facebook's users and existing data from a field experiment.},

Sharp estimates of IIB+-A+I1 are derived for unitary invariant norms when A and B are of the same rank and liB -AiI is small. Under similar conditions the perturbation of a linear system A x = b is studied. Realistic bounds on the perturbation of x =A+b and r =b --Ax are given. Finally it is seen that A+ and B + can be compared if and only if R(A) and R(B) as well as R(A H) and R(BH) are in the a{\textasciitilde}ute case. Some theorems valid only in the acute case are also proved.},

  abstract = {Due to the imbalanced nature of networked observational data, the causal effect predictions for some individuals can severely violate the positivity/overlap assumption, rendering unreliable estimations. Nevertheless, this potential risk of individual-level treatment effect estimation on networked data has been largely under-explored. To create a more trustworthy causal effect estimator, we propose the uncertainty-aware graph deep kernel learning (GraphDKL) framework with Lipschitz constraint to model the prediction uncertainty with Gaussian process and identify unreliable estimations. To the best of our knowledge, GraphDKL is the first framework to tackle the violation of positivity assumption when performing causal effect estimation with graphs. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in uncertainty-aware causal effect estimation on networked data. The code of GraphDKL is available at https://github.com/uqhwen2/GraphDKL.},

  abstract = {Contemporary time series data often feature objects connected by a social network that naturally induces temporal dependence involving connected neighbours. The network vector autoregressive model is useful for describing the influence of linked neighbours, while recent generalizations aim to separate influence and homophily. Existing approaches, however, require either correct specification of a time series model or accurate estimation of a network model or both, and rely exclusively on leastsquares for parameter estimation. This paper proposes a new autoregressive model incorporating a flexible form for latent variables used to depict homophily. We develop a first-order differencing method for the estimation of influence requiring only the influence part of the model to be correctly specified. When the part including homophily is correctly specified admitting a semiparametric form, we leverage and generalize the recent notion of neighbour smoothing for parameter estimation, bypassing the need to specify the generative mechanism of the network. We develop new theory to show that all the estimated parameters are consistent and asymptotically normal. The efficacy of our approach is confirmed via extensive simulations and an analysis of a social media dataset.},

We also give an extension to situations where the matrices under study may be asymmetric or even non-square, and where interest is in the distance between subspaces spanned by corresponding singular vectors.},

  abstract = {Randomized experiments are widely used to estimate the causal effects of a proposed treatment in many areas of science, from medicine and healthcare to the physical and biological sciences, from the social sciences to engineering, and from public policy to the technology industry. Here we consider situations where classical methods for estimating the total treatment effect on a target population are considerably biased due to confounding network effects, i.e., the fact that the treatment of an individual may impact its neighbors' outcomes, an issue referred to as network interference or as nonindividualized treatment response. A key challenge in these situations is that the network is often unknown and difficult or costly to measure. We assume a potential outcomes model with heterogeneous additive network effects, encompassing a broad class of network interference sources, including spillover, peer effects, and contagion. First, we characterize the limitations in estimating the total treatment effect without knowledge of the network that drives interference. By contrast, we subsequently develop a simple estimator and efficient randomized design that outputs an unbiased estimate with low variance in situations where one is given access to average historical baseline measurements prior to the experiment. Our solution does not require knowledge of the underlying network structure, and it comes with statistical guarantees for a broad class of models. Due to their ease of interpretation and implementation, and their theoretical guarantees, we believe our results will have significant impact on the design of randomized experiments.},

Here we propose a general, flexible, and interpretable generative model for overlapping communities, which can be viewed as generalizing several previous models in different ways. We develop an efficient spectral algorithm for estimating the community memberships, which deals with the overlaps by employing the K-medians algorithm rather than the usual K-means for clustering in the spectral domain. We show that the algorithm is asymptotically consistent when the network is not too sparse and the overlaps between communities are not too large. Numerical experiments on both simulated networks and many real social networks demonstrate that our method performs well compared to a number of benchmark methods for overlapping community detection.},
